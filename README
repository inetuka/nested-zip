Mdaemon Nested Zip Mitigation

This script was stirred up to be able to separate nested zip attachments from the mail flow of an MDA.

Steps:
Isolate the message in question from the mail stream by MD content filter rule "If message has file like *.zip then move ...".
Decompose the message to its parts (body, attachments...).
Check content of zip files for more zip files and move message according to outcome.

Tools: (are needed in the system search path i.e. must work from every cmd prompt)
unzip: http://www.info-zip.org/

grep: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm
